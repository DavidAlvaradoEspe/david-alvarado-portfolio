### Architectural Patterns
- **Standalone Components**: Modern Angular without NgModules
- **Signal-based State**: Reactive primitives for state management
- **Service-oriented Design**: Separation of concerns with specialized services
- **Route Reusability Strategy**: Custom routing for optimal performance
- **Lazy Loading**: On-demand resource loading
- **AssetContainer Pattern**: Efficient GLTF model management

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Angular Zone Management
- Babylon rendering runs **outside** Angular's change detection zone
- Manual zone entry only for UI updates
- Prevents unnecessary change detection cycles

### 2. Asset Management
- **AssetContainer pattern** for efficient GLTF loading
- Proper resource disposal on component destroy
- Texture reuse across particle systems
- Single shared DynamicTexture for all particles

### 3. Rendering Pipeline
- Selective glow layers with custom intensity
- Rendering group IDs for proper Z-order layering
- Post-process effects only when visually necessary
- Device-aware quality settings

### 4. Code Splitting
- Lazy imports of Babylon.js modules
- Tree-shaking friendly imports
- Modular service architecture for selective loading

### 5. Mobile Optimization
- Adaptive tessellation levels (4 vs 8 segments)
- Reduced particle counts (20 vs 50 glyphs, 2200 total particles)
- Touch-optimized controls
- Haptic feedback for better UX
